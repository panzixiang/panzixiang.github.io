## Claude Code Updates

Claude Code reached **$1 billion in run-rate revenue** in November 2025—just six months after its public launch—and now holds over half of the AI coding market. The agentic coding tool lives in your terminal, understands your codebase, and helps you code faster through natural language commands. Key recent features include:

- **Plan Mode** - Design and get approval on implementation approaches before writing code, reducing wasted effort
- **Model Switching** - Switch models mid-prompt with Alt+P (Option+P on Mac) for flexibility between speed and capability
- **Sandbox Mode** - Secure execution environment for BashTool on Linux & Mac, enabling safer autonomous operations
- **MCP Tool Search** - Dynamically load tools into context when MCP tools would use >10% of context, reducing token overhead
- **Subagent Improvements** - Claude can resume subagents and dynamically choose models for specialized tasks

## Claude API & Platform Updates

### Advanced Tool Use (November 2025)

Three new beta features for dynamic tool discovery and execution, addressing challenges in building AI agents that work across multiple tools and large datasets:

- **Tool Search Tool** - Discovers tools on-demand instead of loading all definitions upfront. Achieves 85% reduction in token usage while maintaining full tool access. Internal testing showed Opus 4.5 improved from 79.5% to 88.1% accuracy with this feature enabled.
- **Programmatic Tool Calling** - Code-based tool orchestration that reduced average token usage from 43,588 to 27,297 tokens on complex research tasks.
- **Structured Outputs** - Guaranteed schema conformance for responses (beta header: `structured-outputs-2025-11-13`)

### MCP Donated to Linux Foundation (December 2025)

The Model Context Protocol (MCP)—an open standard for connecting AI systems to data sources—was donated to the Linux Foundation's Agentic AI Foundation (AAIF), co-founded by Anthropic, Block, and OpenAI. Often described as "USB-C for AI," MCP provides a universal interface without requiring custom integrations. In its first year:

- Over 10,000 active public servers deployed globally
- Integrated by major platforms: ChatGPT, Cursor, Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, VS Code
- Enterprise infrastructure support from AWS, Cloudflare, Google, Microsoft
