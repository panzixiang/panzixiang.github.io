### Software Engineer at Amazon Alexa

I joined Alexa end of 2019 trying to urther my interest in natural language processing. At Alexa I was part of a few teams, all under natural language understanding, where we match customer commands to intents for the Alexa device to perform (e.g. play songs, order pizza). I led the effort in building a new system for domain developers and business analysts to rapidly deploy new interpretations to Alexa to react to new content releases. Currently leading a  team effort in building a next-generation tooling service to unify interpretation authoring of deterministic artifacts across all locales, domains, and use-cases.

At Amazon I also received my security certification, I am part of the group which reviews new Amazon applications prior to production to ensure compliance with security policies, and advises on architecture to reduce security risks.


### Software Engineer at Microsoft Bing

I built server monitoring and recovery tools, multidimensional metrics as part of server infrastructure. Also built simple ML models to imrpove Bing's search logic to improve latency.
